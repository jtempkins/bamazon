# bamazon
# An Amazon like app that uses a mysql database to hold inventory. Inventory includes item id, product description, category, price and stock quantity.
# Using terminal the program runs and displays all items in inventory with id,description and price. User selects item by id and inputs quantity to purchase.
# App checks inventory against quantity to purchase, if inventory is available to fulfill the quantity the app returns what is being purchased and total amount of purchase. If inventory is insufficient to fulfill the user is notified to try back later.
# If purchase can be completed the database is updated with the new available inventory.
